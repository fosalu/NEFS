# NEFS
NEFS (NFC Exchange File System) is a rudimentary file system for NFC devices that support NDEF storage.

This repository is meant as a way to keep track of the NEFS specification, it's versions and their implementations.
Feel free to include this repository in your project when implementing NEFS.
